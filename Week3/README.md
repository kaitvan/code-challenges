## Instructions

1. In the README file that you create with your repo, write out explanations of the following concepts as if you are explaining it to a 12 year old.  Doing this will help you quickly discover any holes in your understanding.  Ask your questions on Slack.
		
	* Variables -- Variables are short names that can be used to reference a piece of data. If we think of a box with important items inside of it, the label on the box "important-items" would be like the variable and the items inside the box would be the data held inside the box. We can reference all of the items inside the box by using only the variable name "important-items" and the compiler knows we are referring to all of the things inside that box.
	* Strings -- Strings are a data type that can contain numbers, letters, symbols and spaces between quotations. We can use template literals or concatenation to combine multiple strings.
	* Functions (arguments, `return`) -- Functions allow a block of code to execute more than once, every time we call the function. Functions take in arguments, or pieces of data, and use those arguments to perform a specific job, or function. The return statement inside the function, tells the function what it should output when the function is called.
	* `if` statements -- Also known as conditionals! Conditionals allow us to execute a block of code only IF a specific condition is met. We usually use comparison operators to check if a statement is true and then that block of code is executed. If that is not true, it goes to the next condition. An "else" statement is usually included in the event that none of the previous conditions are met. The compiler jumps out of the conditional statement once a condition is met, skipping over any subsequent lines of code in the conditional.
	* Boolean values (`true`, `false`) -- Binary variable, meaning it only has two possible values, true or false. Booleans are helpful, because we can use conditional logic very easily with them.
